# ThatLooksNeat API

A node.js script to grab new campaigns from Mailchimp and add them to the ThatLooksNeat site, we can then grab the content dynamically on the site using js & AJAX.

This is mostly just a fun little experiment to see if I could do it, and to play around with node and ruby. The master branch is currently the node.js implementation but if you check out the `ruby-version` branch you can see the same thing but with ruby.

While I didn't benchmark them on speed, I noticed that the node version is slightly faster but as you can see there is alot more code compared to the ruby version. This could also be because I need to get better with JS.

If anyone can see any improvements please shoot me a PR or submit an issue.
